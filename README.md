# Poker Scoring - Compares two poker hands

## Requirements
For building and running the application you need:

- Java 21 or higher
- Maven 3 or higher

## Assumptions
The validation of the hands is not part of the task. Therefore, the validation has been omitted.

It is also excluded that the Straight Ace-2-3-4-5 is not valid although according to poker rules this is a valid Straight.

## How to run test
- IDE: run test class `com.poker.scoring.business.CompareServiceTest` 
- Shell: run `mvn test` in the root directory
